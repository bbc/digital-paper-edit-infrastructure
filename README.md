# Digital Paper Edit - Infrastructure

This is purely the infrastructural part to tie together the (API)[https://github.com/bbc/digital-paper-edit-api/] and the [client](https://github.com/bbc/digital-paper-edit-client/) of Digital Paper Edit.

## System Architecture

## Usage

* `infrastructure` contains AWS specific configurations.
* `SPEC` contains instructions to build an RPM.
* `dpe-api` contains [API](https://github.com/bbc/digital-paper-edit-api/) specific code.
* `dpe-client` contains [Client](https://github.com/bbc/digital-paper-edit-client/) specific code.

The `Makefile` has instructions that will allow you to build your RPMS and release them.
There are 3 `Makefile`s in this repository:

1. Root level
2. `dpe-api`
3. `dpe-client`

The root level `Makefile` will allow you to package an RPM that will pull in `dpe-client` and `dpe-api` that is released into a `yum` repository in Cosmos. There is nothing else in there. This will be deployed to Cosmos via Jenkins to install and automatically start the services. It is still a WIP, and will not work as is - there still needs to be work done for accessing the `Cosmos yum` repo.

At the `dpe-api` and `dpe-client` `Makefile`, you can build the RPM that pulls in the NPM modules, that contain the logic.

These `Makefile` instructions will only work on BBC CentOS based machines, as it requires certain BBC specific dependencies.

## Development

### Dependencies

Both `dpe-api` and `dpe-client` services pull in a dependency from the BBC NPM.

#### dpe-api

* [API](https://github.com/bbc/digital-paper-edit-api/)

The API Express is directly used without assignment.

#### dpe-client

* [Client](https://github.com/bbc/digital-paper-edit-client/)

### Running

#### Locally

In both `dpe-api` and `dpe-client` run:
```
npm start
```

This will start client and api at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

### Build

#### Cloudformation

You can build the AWS Stacks in `infrastructure` by running `make all`. This will install Python dependencies in your `virtualenv` folder and generate the templates.

### Style guide
<airbnb style, Typescript>

### Deployment

The [Jenkins job](https://jenkins.newslabs.tools.bbc.co.uk/job/digital-paper-edit/) is still WIP, and will not work as is. If you want to update Cloudformation, you will need to do it manually [here](https://cosmos.tools.bbc.co.uk/services/digital-paper-edit-infrastructure).
